# papibot
My personal Discord Bot, mainly used for testing what's possible and how.

I wouldn't have been able to do this without the help of Torri, thank you so much for assisting me through setting this whole thing up!

As well as all those tips you've given me, because I was too lazy to google myself.

Papi-Bot has come quite far and thanks to iAlusion she now runs on a VPS, 24/7, I'm so proud and happy about this! Thank you so much for sharing your VPS with me, this is one of the most generous things someone could do for me, ever. I will never forget you this deed!
